    <h1>Adding Thumbnails in ours posts WordPress</h1>
        <p>
            For this, we must use theme support with param post-thumbnails
        </p>
        <p>
            This code is adding into functions.php file
        </p>
        <p>
            After adding code, let's to our theme and can see of sidebar the metabox <strong>Featured image</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let's add image into index.php for example with the function <?php the_post_thumbnail( 'thumb' );?>
            also we can create thumbnails of customize size with an array( 225,345 ) for example, as params
